CALIBRACIÃ“N 24/08/2023:

Sensor readings with offsets:	-7	-4	16386	0	0	0
Your offsets:	-1423	-1681	1025	-18	10	-19

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to 
    "mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)"
